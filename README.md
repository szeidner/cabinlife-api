# CabinLife API

A simple PHP project containing a router and PDO objects to return post data from a database in a JSON format.

To get an array of all posts, call `/post`

To return a single post, call `/post/{post_id}`

In addition to the posts API, this project contains a parser that crawls RSS feeds and imports data into a database.
